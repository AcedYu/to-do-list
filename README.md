# To Do List

## Overview

The **To Do List** project is an educational tool designed to help aspiring developers understand the basics of web development. This simple yet powerful application allows users to add and delete items from a list, offering a hands-on experience with essential web technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. By working on this project, learners will build a strong foundation in front-end development and gain practical skills that are crucial for more complex projects.

## Educational Objectives

- **HTML Form Handling:** Learn how to create and manage forms in HTML, enabling users to input data that can be processed and displayed dynamically.
- **JavaScript DOM Manipulation:** Gain experience in manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically add, remove, and modify list items based on user input.
- **Event Handling:** Understand how to capture and respond to user interactions such as button clicks, allowing for real-time updates to the list.
- **Code Organization and Best Practices:** Learn the importance of organizing your code in a logical manner, making it easier to maintain and extend in the future.

## How to Use This Project for Learning

1. **Examine the Code Structure:**
   - Begin by reviewing the `index.html` file to understand how the user interface is constructed.
   - Explore the `script.js` file to understand how JavaScript is used to handle user input and manipulate the DOM.

2. **Experiment with the Code:**
   - Modify the HTML to add new features or change the layout.
   - Adjust the CSS to experiment with different styles, colors, and layouts.
   - Try extending the JavaScript functionality by adding new features, such as editing list items or sorting them.

3. **Build and Expand:**
   - Use this project as a foundation to build more complex applications.
   - Challenge yourself by exploring the basics of storing data using local storage, giving users the ability to save their list items even after refreshing the page.
